# flutter_android_web_socket

A Flutter demo project to use native Android websocket as a plugin

What's Done:
1. Basic app UI
2. Basic Native Web Socket Plugin + fetch from wss
3. Interval random timer to fetch colour info
4. Basic second screen to display colour info detail
5. Fetch data from rest api
6. Basic unit test

What's Incomplete:
1. Hook up all the components
2. UI touch ups
3. Customised screen/layout
4. More decoupling into individual functions
5. More memory optimisation
6. Focus more on using a MVVM pattern
